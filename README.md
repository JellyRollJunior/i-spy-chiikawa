    -   Stopwatch to show score
    -   Guess success / Guess fail feedback (see gif above)

### API Gameplay loop

1. call GET /games to get available games + image urls
2. call GET /games/:gameId/assets to retrieve game data and token to start gameplay
3. call POST /games/:gameId/guesses (with token) to play the game and make guesses (until all targets found)
    - Updated token will be returned to use on future /guesses requests (if guess is successful)
4. call POST /winners once all targets founds to record win time
5. call PUT /winners to let user name the winner

### Learning Outcomes

-   Backend

    -   Practice designing API and API workflow to play game
    -   First time using SuperTest to test route responses
    -   Using a test database & production database!
    -   Normalizing image coordinates

-   Frontend

    -   Global notifications using context API
        -   any component can trigger a notification by retrieving create notification functions using context API
    -   Relearning vitest (mocking hooks/components, user events, dynamic mocks, snapshot tests)
    -   Animating react components (fade ins, fade outs)

### Retrospective aka yapping

-   I really put my all into make this a project I can showcase on my portfolio. Hope you like it!
-   I learned I prefer working on backend then frontend (else I get confused!)
    -   Next time implement all backend features (image storage) before working on the frontend
-   Designed API and API workflow myself (proud!)
-   Thought of storing player session info in jsonwebtoken myself (proud!!)
-   NOTIFICATIONS TOOK ME SO LONG BUT I DID IT I AM VERY PROUD OF MYSELF
-   I created a timer using intervals! first time using intervals
